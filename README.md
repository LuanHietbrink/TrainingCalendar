# TrainingCalendar

## Description

This is a small personal project of mine that allows users to track their training. 
As a track and field athlete I usually kept logs of my training in either Excel or a plain notebook. I wanted something online and dedicated for my use cases. This is still a work in progress but I am happy with how it is turning out so far.
